# 🧠 Maze Solver – Built with DAA Logic by Pavni Manocha

A smart and interactive Maze Solver that visualizes graph traversal algorithms in action. Designed to assist with solving complex maze patterns using the power of **DAA (Design & Analysis of Algorithms)** and clean frontend aesthetics.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Interactive Maze Interface (HTML + CSS + JS)
- 🧭 Algorithm Visualizer (DFS, BFS, A* Heuristics, Dijkstra)
- 🔌 Python-Powered Backend for path solving
- 🧠 Built as part of a DAA project with practical implementation of graph theory

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Frontend | Backend | Algorithm |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Python (Django/Flask*) | DFS, BFS, Graph Coloring |
